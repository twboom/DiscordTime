# DiscordTime
Create a dynamic timestamp for Discord!

## What are dynamic timestamps?
Almost a year ago, Discord released a feature that allowed users to send a timestamp that would render the local time in the message. An example use case for this is in announcements, where you want to send a message that contains a time (e.g. "The meeting will be at 12:00"). With the timestamps, everybody sees the time in their local timezone.

[Here][documentation] is the official documentation about this. More information can be found there.

## What does this tool do?
Since the timestamp feature requires the time to be in UNIX time, it isn't as easy as typing the time. This tool allows users to easily create the timestamp.
